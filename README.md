# Babak Farkhoopak

`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Creator/Contributor)`

All of my projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing, all the way to building fully-functional solutions. I have built websites, open-source tools, Wordpress themes and plugins, and more. I have contributed to communities and helped people in building their applications. I have an eye on design and user experience.
