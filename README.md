`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Creator/Contributor)`

I'm an indie JavaScript Frontend Developer. All of my coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. I'm currently building projects with SvelteJS, and NodeJS and trying out DenoJS. I have an eye for developing apps with great design and user experience. I have developed many projects on open source in many ecosystems like Svelte, VanillaJS, SASS/SCSS, Wordpress, Elementor and etc.
